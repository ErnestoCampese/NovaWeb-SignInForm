# Sign-In Form Practice

This repository contains the code and necessary files for a sign-in form page used as a practice project to showcase my knowledge of CSS, Flexbox, and HTML form implementation. The sign-in form provides an opportunity for me to demonstrate my skills and understanding of front-end development concepts.

## Technologies Used ⚙️

The sign-in form page is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5: The structure and layout of the page.
- CSS3: Styling and visual enhancements, with a focus on Flexbox for layout.
